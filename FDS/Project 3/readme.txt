As you can see, there is only one C-file and everything is integrated in that file. If you want to test the performance of this file, you can run the file directly with the standard input format. The output is the standard output. Some of the comments may have spelling errors, please forgive me. The code may be a bit long and boring, if you can read through and give valuable advice, I am infinitely grateful.
